# XGizmo

*"Extra gizmos for Serious Engine"*

This is a collection of headers that extend [Serious Engine 1](https://github.com/Croteam-official/Serious-Engine) functionality by adding a variety of convenient classes and functions atop existing engine code. Mostly useful with [Serious Sam SDK](https://github.com/DreamyCecil/SE1-ModSDK) where the engine code isn't directly available.

This project came about thanks to [Classics Patch](https://github.com/SamClassicPatch) because of the need for new ways of working with the engine without direct access to its code.

# Libraries

- `Base` - Various common functionality
- `Entities` - Functions related to world entities
- `Interfaces` - Various interfaces full of useful methods
- `Objects` - Special structures and classes
- `Vanilla` - Functionality for interacting with vanilla games (The First Encounter, The Second Encounter)

# Usage

Simply include any header from this repository into your project on Serious Engine 1 and use its classes and functions.
